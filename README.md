# Online_Retailer_Database
This is a Python project that defines a database schema for an online retailer using the SQLAlchemy library. The database contains several tables that represent customers, orders, products, sales, and returns, with various relationships between them.

The project includes a script to create the database schema and a sample data insertion script. Additionally, it provides an example of how to use SQLAlchemy to query the database and perform various operations, such as adding new records or updating existing ones.

This project is intended to be a starting point for anyone interested in building a database for an online retailer or similar e-commerce application. You can clone the repo and customize the database schema to fit your needs or use it as a reference for building your own database.
